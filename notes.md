4. The Art of Perception:  Seeing What Matters Now, Amy E. Herman, 
"pertinent negative"- talk about what's not there (as well as what is there); You are accountable, do not reach for what you want to see. Do not use words like "obviously" and "clearly", instead "it appears to be a case of x due to y and z.."
